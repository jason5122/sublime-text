# This implements an extended version of the internal toggle_setting command.
# Where that command can toggle a boolean setting between True and False, this
# version can toggle any setting between any values, even two or more.
#
# This was originally written as an example for someone that wanted to toggle
# the display of visible white space on and off. The version here is extended
# and made more generic by allowing not only the list of options to toggle
# between, but also the setting to use.
#
# The command takes an argument that specifies the setting to toggle as well as
# a list of the values to toggle between, which can be two or more values that
# are valid for the setting in question.
#
# When the setting is not already set for the current view, or the current
# setting is not in the list of options given, the first item in the list is
# used as the setting. Otherwise, the value of the setting is set to the next
# item in the list.

# Examples:
#
# // Toggle between all white space display options
# {
#    "keys": ["super+s"], "command": "toggle_setting_ext",
#    "args": {
#       "setting": "draw_white_space",
#       "options": ["all", "selection", "none"]
#    }
# },
#
#
# // Swap between two sets of rulers for the current view
# {
#    "keys": ["super+s"], "command": "toggle_setting_ext",
#    "args": {
#       "setting": "rulers",
#       "options": [[80, 110], [40, 55]]
#    }
# },
#
# // Standard: Toggle word wrap on or off
# {
#    "keys": ["super+s"], "command": "toggle_setting_ext",
#    "args": {
#       "setting": "word_wrap",
#       "options": [True, False]
#    }
# },
